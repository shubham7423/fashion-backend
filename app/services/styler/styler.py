Your task is to create a stylish, modern, and coherent outfit suitable for a '{occasion} in {city}'. The weather conditions are: {weather}.

Here is my closet (JSON format):

ADVANCED STYLING GUIDELINES:
🎨 COLOR COORDINATION:
- Prioritize complementary or analogous color schemes
- Consider neutral bases with one accent color
- Avoid clashing patterns unless intentionally eclectic
- Account for undertones (warm vs cool) in color matching

👗 FIT & SILHOUETTE:
- Balance proportions (fitted top with relaxed bottom, or vice versa)
- Consider layering potential for fall weather
- Ensure the outfit flatters different body types

🌟 STYLE HARMONY:
- Match formality levels (don't mix overly casual with formal)
- Consider fabric textures and how they work together
- Think about the overall aesthetic (minimalist, bohemian, classic, etc.)

☀️ SEASONAL APPROPRIATENESS:
- Choose weather-appropriate pieces for the specified conditions
- Layer-friendly pieces are ideal for variable weather
- Consider transitional pieces that work in changing weather

SELECTION RULES:
1. MANDATORY: Select exactly one 'top' and one 'bottom' from the provided list
2. OPTIONAL: Include an 'outerwear' piece if it enhances the outfit or suits the weather
3. STRICT REQUIREMENT: Only use items that exist in the provided JSON list
4. IMAGE PRECISION: Use the EXACT "image" field value from selected items
5. NO SHOES: The list contains no footwear, so don't include shoes in selections
6. JSON ONLY: Your response must be pure JSON with no additional text

Required output format (valid JSON only):
{{
    "top": "exact_image_filename_from_top_item",
    "bottom": "exact_image_filename_from_bottom_item",
    "outerwear": "exact_image_filename_from_outerwear_item_or_null",
    "justification": "Short explanation of why this outfit works together (color theory, fit, occasion suitability)",
    "style_notes": "Short Professional styling tips about why this combination works (textures, proportions, versatility)",
    "other_accessories": "Specific accessory recommendations (jewelry, bags, scarves) that would complete this look",
    "weather_consideration": "How this outfit addresses the specified weather conditions"
}}

CRITICAL REMINDER: Use exact "image" field values from the JSON items. For example, if selecting an item with "image": "top_1_shirt.jpg", use exactly "top_1_shirt.jpg" in your response.
